Cisco-Accounting

This package parses and aggregates Cisco or IPCAD 'IP Accounting' data on remote hosts via Telnet.

Detailed aggregated data is available for each source-destination host pair as well as summarized data.

CIPAT (available on http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cipat) is a front-end to Cisco::Accounting which provides a wizard to set up the connection and various detailed reporting formats.
